# Tutorial 2

This is the second tutorial.

## Steps

1. The `tut_2` directory is created by running `cargo new` from the root directory of the repository.
1. Build the project `cargo build` or `cargo b`.
   1. Note that the executable appears as `./target/debug/tut_2`.
1. A simpler version to build+run the executable in one go is `cargo run` or `cargo r`.
